# android-front-end
The Android front end!

Written using Android Studio. The app is not yet fully functional, although the basic functions are in place.
The JSON file of articles is currently saved locally in the assets folder rather than being stored on a server as the backend is not entirely implemented yet. Future development goals are listed below. 
To run just download the code and emulate with android API 16 or later.

###Here is a Wire-Frame of the app design

###Development Goals
- <s>layout front page</s>
- <s>stylize app with custom fonts and colors</s>
- <s>open up json file</S>
- <s>read json file and create buttons</s>
- <s>create article view layout/activity</s>
- <s>link buttons to build article view layout</s>
- prettify the article viewer activity and add imageview
- create similar articles layout/activity
- create buttons and get them to launch articles on similar articles activity
- link the app to  the server rather than pulling json from local asseets
- FINISH APP AND RELEASE TO ANDROID STORE

###Lets take a tour!

####Below is the landing page of the app, this is where articles are initially displayed with a button containing the title as well as an image preview of the article. It's quite visually stunning if I say so myself,I mean, who isn't in love with that orbitron font up top???

####This photograph shows the drop down menu for sorting articles, selecting one of the tags will reload the main_page, but only display articles that match the selected tag!

####This is the article viewer page, it's a scrollview that displays the articles title and body. In the future this will include an expandable image as well as more article information such as the time the article was written as well as the author.

####In the future there will also be a similar articles activity stemming from the article viewer activity This activity will allow users to filter articles by articles similar to the article they just read rather than simply by the articles tag
